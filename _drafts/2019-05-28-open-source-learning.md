Over the past few years there have been a handful of skills I've picked up along the way.

Drumming. Programming. Drawing. Gymnastics/calisthenics.

Get good at anything and eventually you'll get the inevitable questions like, "Hey I'm thinking about learning ${skill}. Got any tips?"

I'm all for avoiding wasted effort in the early stages but more often than not a lot of people simply don't know how to get started. They have a goal but even with a search engine they have no clue on what the first steps might be. Or maybe they're just lazy.

The world moves faster than ever. Relevant skills today may not be relevant tomorrow. Adjusting your skillset accordingly is a must.

If you're a self starter, no problem. But if you're someone who asks the type of question I mentioned above, you'll be waiting until an entrepreneur creates the structure for you to learn whatever skillset it is you want.

The ability to teach yourself something new may be the most important skill to have. You'll not only be in a minority of people who can do it but you're self-sufficient.

I feel like I've done my part with software development. I self-published a book covering a popular web framework that's over 500 pages. The reception has been good.

But now I want to take a completely different approach with a completely new skill: learning a foreign language. Korean.

I can't think of many people who *wouldn't* want to know a second language whether it's to impress a dinner date, reap the cognitive benefits, or dwell in the satisfaction of navigating your way through another culture.

But like most things, people come up with excuses. *I'm too old.* *I don't have the time.* *I don't know how to get started.* *You can't teach yourself a new language.*

So my latest project is going to address two needs at the same time.

First, I'm going to learn a new language. This satisfies my own personal desire to be bilingual.

Second, I'm going to do it all publicly. For lack of a better term, I'm "open sourcing" the entire process.

Rather than learning a new language on my own and then publishing a blog post or YouTube video about the process once I'm fluent, I've decided to livestream the entire process on Twitch.

I'll be learning publicly and failing publicly. Live.

It's not an easy pill to swallow. If I'm progressing slowly, it'll be obvious.

So many people are scared to speak their new languages, if they even pick one up, so maybe Twitch will help this aspect as well. I'll have near daily experience with struggling through vocabulary, pronunciation, reading, grammar, and everything else that goes with learning a new language.

I like this approach for a few reasons.

1. Collaboration - I imagine many people tuning into my stream will either know Korean already or be interested in learning Korean if they aren't already in the process. Korean speakers will be able to give me feedback through chat (which has already happened), people who are already learning can share resources with me (also already happened), and people who are interested in learning can see my approach and borrow resources from me.
2. Accountability - Doing this publicly will make me more disciplined about learning Korean. I'll not only want to keep my audience happy by continuing to stream my process but publicly stating a goal puts your name and reputation on the goal. It worked for self-publishing my first book so I figured it can't hurt to do it here either.
3. Novelty - I don't know of too many people who are livestreaming themselves learning a new language from day 1. Someone in my Twitch chat has already asked, "Is this something people do? Stream learning a language?"
4. Transparency -
