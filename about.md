## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/adam-korea.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I started my career in marketing consulting working with a variety of Fortune 500 companies. My main focus was data analysis but after coding a few internal tools I eventually decided to quit my job and enter the tech industry.

Since then I spend most of my time working with JavaScript and MEAN stacks. I've worked in a variety of environments ranging from Fortune 500 companies to startups and creative agencies. Across these companies, I've taken various roles ranging from full-stack development to UI design and UX research.
